# ssb-ws

ssb-ws & http server for ssb.

``` js
sbot plugins.install ssb-ws
```

best configured via [connections config](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-config#connections)

``` json
"connections": {
  "incoming": {
    "ws": {
      "scope": ["public", "local", "device"],
      "port": 9000,
      "transform": "shs"
    }
  }
}
```

## noauth

given the flexibility of multiserver, you may want to run
this with noauth config locally. However this is ***not recommended***
until ssb-ws prevents [dns rebinding attacks](https://medium.com/@brannondorsey/attacking-private-networks-from-the-internet-with-dns-rebinding-ea7098a2d325)
and websocket connections from locally open websites.

If used with a [secure transport](https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secret-handshake),
that authenticates the client `"transport": "shs"`
then this is not a problem.

## adding your own http handlers

sometimes you need to do http, but if every plugin that did that
created it's own servers there would be mass panic.
But never fear, with ssb-ws, you can add http handlers
as [connect style middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stack)

Here is an example sbot plugin that
adds a single route: to output the current sbot address.

``` js
require('scuttlebot')
  .use(require('ssb-ws'))
  .use({
    name: 'test123',
    version: '1.0.0',
    init: function (sbot) {
      sbot.ws.use(function (req, res, next) {
        if(req.url == '/get-address')
          res.end(sbot.getAddress('device'))
        else next()
      })
    }
  })
```
